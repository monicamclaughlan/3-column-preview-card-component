## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Utilized flexbox to keep design responsive throughout size of device.

```css
div.container { 
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 1410px;
    
}
```

### Continued development
Want to continue to get comfortable with flexbox and add in CSS Grid to styling.  Begin to add javascript for functionality.

### Useful resources

- [Hover over interactive elements 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) - This helped me implement a hover effect on the buttons.
